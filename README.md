# LangDjangoAIX ðŸš€: Multi-Agent AI System with Django & LangChain

## Overview

LangDjangoAIX is a Django-based project that integrates AI agents for document management and movie discovery. It leverages language models to provide users with intelligent assistance in organizing their documents and exploring movie information.

âœ… **Django-native AI Agents** - Query your ORM directly (no vector DB required)  
âœ… **Role-Based Access Control** - Secure agents with [Permit.io](https://www.permit.io/)  
âœ… **Multi-Agent Supervision** - Coordinate agents with [LangGraph](https://langchain.com/langgraph)  
âœ… **LLM Agnostic** - Swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.  
âœ… **Tool Creation** - Turn any Python function into an agent tool

## Features

- **Document Management:**
  - Create, retrieve, and manage documents.
  - Search documents by title or content.
  - AI-powered assistance for document-related tasks.
- **Movie Discovery:**
  - Search for movies using the TMDB API.
  - Retrieve detailed information about movies.
  - AI-driven recommendations for movie exploration.
- **User Authentication and Permissions:**
  - Built-in Django user authentication.
  - Role-based permission management using Permit.
- **AI Agents:**
  - Document management agent.
  - Movie discovery agent.
  - Supervisor agent for task assignment.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** Web framework
- **Langchain:** Framework for building language model applications
- **OpenAI API:** Language model
- **TMDB API:** Movie database
- **Permit:** Permission management
- **uv:** Python package installer and resolver
- **SQLite:** Database

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jiten0709/LangDjangoAIX.git
    cd LangDjangoAIX
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply migrations:**

    ```bash
    python src/manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python src/manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python src/manage.py runserver
    ```

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Create a `.env` file in the root directory by refering .env.example file.

## Usage

1.  **Access the Django admin interface:**

    - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` in your browser.
    - Log in with the superuser credentials created during setup.

2.  **Create and manage documents:**

    - Use the admin interface to create, edit, and delete documents.

3.  **Interact with the AI agents:**

    - Use the provided functions in the notebooks to interact with the AI agents for document management and movie discovery.

## Key Components

- **`src/ai/`:** Contains the AI-related components.
  - `agents.py`: Defines the AI agents.
  - `llm.py`: Manages the language model.
  - `supervisor.py`: Orchestrates the AI agents.
  - `tools/`: Contains the tools used by the AI agents.
- **`src/documents/`:** Contains the Django app for document management.
  - `models.py`: Defines the document model.
  - `views.py`: Handles the document views.
- **`src/main/`:** Contains the main Django project settings.
- **`notebooks/`:** Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and demonstration.
  - `1-django-users-permissions.ipynb`: Demonstrates Django user and permission management.
  - `2-django-built-in-permissions.ipynb`: Demonstrates Django built-in permissions.
  - `3-verify-llm-django.ipynb`: Verifies the integration of the language model with Django.
